# ETCH - Evidence based therapy for chronic pain
University of Roehampton - A group therapy for Chronic pain patients

ETCH is an integrative treatment based largely on Acceptance and Commitment therapy (ACT), mindfulness based CBT, and fear-avoidance behavioural therapies. These treatments have been integrated using an inductive process based on evidence supporting the efficacty of their specific components. The evidence guiding the first integration process was attained from randomised controlled studies, and from the quantitative and qualitative analysis of data gathered in a pain clinic funded by NHS England (National Health Service, England UK). The result was a protocol documenting the delivery of a group therapy aimed at helping chronic pain patients living their life despite the limitations imposed by their physical condition.
